### Who am I?
My name is Klaudijus Rulys, I'm an avid software developer aiming for technical excellence. This site acts as a way for me to structure and compartmentalize my thoughts on tools, ways of working and best practises in the industry. 

### Who should find this interesting?
People who, like me, strive for technical excellence. Hopefully this can serve as one of your sites that you visit to get a different point of view to a problem. Hopefully someday it can serve as a resource to share with your coworkers as a summary of arguments of why a principle/concept is beneficial to your organization.
