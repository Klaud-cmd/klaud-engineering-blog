## Introduction: Che Guavara

If you would look back at the history of the tools and concepts that you, a developer, have used in your workplace, you'll often see that it, much like real-life history is not always a clear path. Depending on how long you've been in your current workplace, you may remember when your workplace shifted from the Waterfall development methodology to the Agile development methodology. You have reminisce about the time your team shifted from PHP to JavaScript. It's also likely that these changes were brought on by **technical revolutionaries**. But what is a technical revolutionary?

Che Guavara lived a privileged life as a medical student, hoping to ease the life of the poor through the his medical skills. However, he decided to leave his life of privilege and tour rural Latin America. What he saw amongst the poor people struggling in rural villages, led him to believe that saving lives required more than medicine. Thus, he took to become a revolutionary, helping to overthrow the Cuban government and dying as an icon of revolution worldwide.

Much like Che Guavara, a technical revolutionary is someone who has come to understand that exceptional performance is not enough to achieve technical excellence in a company. Often, a monumental change needs to take place and much like in history, it is required to overthrow the current regime. 

## Start a revolution with the right ideals
